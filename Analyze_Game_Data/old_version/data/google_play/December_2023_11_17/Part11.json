  "describe": "A Dance of Fire and Ice is a simple one-button rhythm game. Keep your focus as you guide two orbiting planets down a path without breaking their perfect equilibrium.It's pretty hard to describe, but you should play the free online version on a desktop computer first if you are not sure you would enjoy this game!Features:- 20 worlds, each introducing new shapes and rhythms. What do triangles, octagons or squares sound like? Each world has its own unique hand-drawn fantasy landscape, and has short tutorial levels followed by a full-length boss level.- Post-game challenges: Speed Trials for each world and blisteringly fast bonus levels for the brave.- Play new levels for free: more levels will be added over the coming months.- Calibration options: Auto-calibration and manual calibration. This is a precise rhythm game, so please use your ears more than your eyes when playing.WARNING: This is a hard rhythm game. Not in the sense of note-spamming - for the most part you just need to keep a consistent beat - but keeping a beat is not very easy. So don't worry if you find it difficult!",
