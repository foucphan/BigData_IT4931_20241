With familiar but well-refined activities, as well as brand new activities, building a Space Empire has never been more rewarding.¬†Create and grow your space Empire, in a persistent galaxy that constantly evolves.EXPLORE AND COLONIZE YOUR VERY OWN YELLOW STAR SYSTEMAs the most stable star type, the Yellow Star offers a perfect setting to establish your permanent presence and plan your Empire's long term economy. All new players start in their own Yellow Star system and over time expand to discover and colonize more planets, set mining patterns, establish trade routes and neutralize the mysterious alien ships found throughout the Hades galaxy.As the owner of a Yellow Star system, you have complete control over what other players have access to it. By establishing diplomatic relations, you can allow any other player to send ships to your system, and dictate your own terms for mining, trade or military cooperation.COOPERATIVE PVE IN RED STARSVery early in the game, every player will build a Red Star Scanner, a station that allows them to jump ships to detected Red Stars. These stars have a small lifetime and will go supernova after 10 minutes.The goal in the Red Star is to co-operate with any other players that have ships in that star system, defeat the NPC ships, retrieve Artifacts from the Red Star planets, and jump back before the Supernova. Artifacts can be researched in the home star and will yield necessary resources for trade, mining and combat advancements. Higher level Red Stars offer more challenging enemies and better rewards.TEAM PVP IN WHITE STARSPlayers can organize in Corporations. Besides helping each other, Corporations can also scan for White Stars. A White Star sees 20 players from two Corporations battle in the same star system for Relics, a resource that can be retrieved to upgrade the Corporation and give each member additional benefits.Time passes by very slowly in White Stars: every match lasts for 5 days, giving Corporation members time to talk and coordinate their strategy. The Time Machine can be used to plan future moves, communicate them to other Corporation members, and see potential outcomes of future combat.EXCITING PVP IN BLUE STARSBlue Stars are short lived combat arenas that only last for a few minutes, during which the entire system is collapsing on itself. Each player can only send a single Battleship to the Blue Star. The 5 participating players combat each other, using their ship's modules and other NPC ships to destroy the other player Battleships and be the last one alive.Blue Stars offer the fastest PvP action in the game. Regular participants receive daily and monthly rewards to advance their Empire.",

Through face-to-face communication with Franz, visual novel gameplay and phone notifications, you can find out who she really is and what she truly desires. Moral choices form the narrative foundation of the story. The decisions that you make as this interactive story game progresses determine whether you become the rightful owner of Franz or turn into her puppet.The gameplay of Franz is based on a text-rich story and tactile interaction with the character. Your smartphone is Franz herself, so you need to be much more careful with the device. Franz is unpredictable and touchy, but is very much into you. She is susceptible to physical interaction, just like any real person. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the consequences of your choices when communicating with her, even those that may seem insignificant.This visual novel is based on physical interaction with a smartphone, namely:‚óè Word puzzle solving gameOne of the main ways of interacting with Franz is by solving various puzzles that illustrate the complexity of communication between people. Like in real dialogue, you can misunderstand something or miss an important detail, which can affect future interactions. Words in this text-rich story game, like in real life, are an important tool of communication, and should be handled with care.‚óè Touches and choicesYou can express your attitude towards Franz through tactile contact, using gentle or aggressive touches. Franz can both ask for your affection and try to provoke you. It is up to you whether to submit to Franz or resist her manipulations as you go through the scary visual novel.‚óè The interactive story game with a time factorFranz can kick you out of the app and lock you out of it for a certain period of time. You can choose whether to wait until Franz lets you back into the game or be the one who makes the choices of your own. For example, you may attempt to interrupt the waiting time, but it can hurt Franz in the process.‚óè Response to notifications Franz can send notifications when she wants you back in the game. Depending on how quickly you open the app after receiving the notification, Franz will either be offended or delighted.‚óè Non-linear narrative in the puzzle solving gameFranz is a living entity that reacts differently to every action of yours, whether it's touching her, solving puzzles, ignoring her desires, or indulging her emotional manipulations. Therefore, depending on your behavior and choices, this scary interactive story will change.Plunge into the scary interactive story game about a choice between tenderness and severity.

Envisaged in 3D for the first time, there are dozens of locations to roam inside and outside of school - as well as an abundance of fully interactive props to get you through the day. You can also fine-tune the camera to enjoy the action from a variety of different angles.Choose from hundreds of preset characters of any age, or upgrade to create your own by saving your changes to every character in the editor. Just when you think you've seen it all, a whole other career as a teacher awaits - which challenges you to impart knowledge as successfully as you learnt it!* Acknowledging that school is the first (and only) place that many people experience violence, this is an unflinching exploration of how true morality can only ever grow out of the muddy waters of immorality. The game depicts a fictitious universe. Any similarity to real people, past or present, is coincidental.",
