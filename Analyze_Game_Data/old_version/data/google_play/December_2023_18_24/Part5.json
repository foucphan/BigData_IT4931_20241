Stay tuned for some twists and turns!Story ------------------------------------------On a tiny side street in a nameless little neighborhood sits anold Japanese diner. Things are quiet here; old-fashionedyou might say. But of course they are. It's Showa era Japan,and the television is just starting to come into vogue.Slide open the screen door and you'll see a kindly old ladyhard at work behind the counter. Her husband's been sickfor a while, and she's had to run the place on her own.It's hard work, but she's a tough one, and she gets by.Sit down at one of the worn wooden tables, and close youreyes.
